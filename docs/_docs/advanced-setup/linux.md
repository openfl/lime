title: Setup Linux
---

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for Linux.

## Manual Install

No additional setup is required for most Linux systems.

You may need to install `g++` if it is not present already, and if you intend to compile 32-bit applications from a 64-bit distribution, you will also want `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib`, or their equivalents.

If you build Lime from the source, you will also need `libgl1-mesa-dev` and `libglu1-mesa-dev`.

You can only target Linux from a Linux system right now. If you are interested in contributing to cross-desktop builds to Linux, please open a topic on the forums.
