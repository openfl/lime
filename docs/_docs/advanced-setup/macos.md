title: Setup macOS

## Automatic Install

There is no automatic setup available for macOS.

## Manual Install

In order to build Neko applications for macOS, no further dependencies are required. However, in order to build C++ applications for macOS, you must have a current version of Xcode installed.

You can find Xcode in the macOS App Store.

You can only target macOS from an Apple system right now. If you are interested in contributing to cross-desktop builds to macOS, please open a topic on the forums.

## Forums

You should not need to install the Xcode command-line tools. If this is not the case, or if you encounter other problems when setting up Lime for macOS, please visit the [forums](http://community.openfl.org/c/help).
