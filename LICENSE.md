-------

Native dependencies include unrestrictive licenses, such as the Zlib, MIT, or BSD
license. The full text of each license is included in each sub-repository. The 
notable exception is OpenAL Soft, which is LGPL-licensed.

When Lime is compiled to a shared binary, the LGPL "copy-left" clause will apply
to Lime's C++ source-code, but not to other aspects of a project. When Lime
is statically linked to project code, OpenAL Soft is not included.
